# 🖐️ Action Detection with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **action/gesture detection** using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The Jupyter Notebook `Action_Detection_Refined.ipynb` contains the end-to-end workflow:
- Extracting landmarks from video frames  
- Preprocessing data  
- Training a deep learning model  
- Running real-time action recognition

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

It is recommended to create a virtual environment. Then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open **`Action_Detection_Refined.ipynb`** and execute cells step by step.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Capture frames via webcam using OpenCV.
   * Extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
   * Save sequences of landmarks for training.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Normalize landmark coordinates.
   * Organize into time-series sequences.

3. **Model Training**

   * Deep Learning model (LSTM/Conv1D with TensorFlow/Keras).
   * Train on labeled gestures/actions.

4. **Real-Time Action Detection**

   * Live video stream → Landmark extraction → Model prediction.
   * Display detected action on-screen.
